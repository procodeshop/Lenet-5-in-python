LeNet-5, developed by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998, stands as a landmark achievement in deep learning. This pioneering convolutional neural network (CNN) revolutionized handwritten digit recognition, specifically on the MNIST dataset, and laid the groundwork for todayâ€™s advanced image recognition technologies. Its elegant architecture and efficient design made it a crucial stepping stone in the development of deep learning. Even today, understanding LeNet-5 provides valuable insights into the core concepts of CNNs. Its simple yet effective architecture allowed for breakthroughs in a time with limited computational resources.
